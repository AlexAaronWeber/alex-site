        Scrum's Magical Pet Shop is an online merchant where you can find and
        adopt magical creatures from Scrum, the "Fancy Goblin!" Check out our
        crazy creatures, (there's a surprise if you're a Star Wars fan)! This
        project is practice with javascript creating events and event listeners,
        as well as calculations based on a point of sale system.
